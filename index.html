				<h2>Personal Information</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hey! My name is Brian Rabino. My student number is S3851265, student email address is S3851265@student.rmit.edu.au. Please contact me if you have any questions about the project!</p>
			
			<p>A bit about me... I'm 21 years old, Filipino, born and raised in the UK, and moved to Australia in 2014. However, I speak English and only understand a little Filipino. So far, I've completed VCE Year 12, and I am currently in my final year for my Bachelor in Information Technology. I found my favourite hobby, volleyball, last year when Victoria eased restrictions and I currently play in social competitions. I hope to play for state clubs next year! </p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<p>Originally inspired to enter the field through experiencing Virtual Reality software, I impulsively decided to transfer from a career in Science and Biomedicine to a career in software development. I transferred into a Bachelor of CS at RMIT, from a Bachelor of Science at The University of Melbourne. As I completed my CS degree throughout 2020, I took a myriad of IT subjects along the way, which gave me insight and understanding in the systems and networks field. Managing, configuring, and protecting computer systems had always interested me, and was a bright prospect as a future career upon graduating from RMIT. My IT experience is limited to building PCs, configuring Windows software from scratch, diagnosing and providing solutions to family/friends’ Windows devices.</p>
					<p>I chose to transfer to RMIT as, during my research in the best Computer Science and Information Technology degrees, RMIT was always at, or near the top of the lists and rankings. Upon exploring the RMIT website and reading what the CS and IT degrees offer, and comparing these to other programs at different universities, I chose to enrol in RMIT for the best possible chance at preparing myself for the workforce.</p>
					<p>Throughout my studies, I have experienced a wide range of areas in the IT industry, from cybersecurity and penetration testing to software programming and website development. In my last year, I expect to explore further into more advanced concepts of IT and gain a deeper understanding of management and configuration of computer and network systems, as well as how IT is used from a business standpoint.</p>
